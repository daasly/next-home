						<h3>Daasly Use of “Cookies”</h3>
						<p>
							Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to an
							individual’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies allow
							us to recognize you and information about you that aids in our
							ability to meet your business needs when you reenter the Site. We
							may collect information about your computer, including your IP
							address, operating system and browser type, for system
							administration and in order to create reports. This is statistical
							data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns, and does not
							identify any individual. Most web browsers automatically accept
							cookies. Typically, however, you may configure your browser to
							refuse all cookies or notify you when a cookie is being sent.
						</p>
						<h3>We use cookies in the following ways:</h3>
						<p>
							(1) To personalize the Site. We may use cookies in order to
							personalize your experience with the Site by displaying content we
							believe might interest you based on your information.
						</p>
						<p>
							(2) To estimate the size of our audience. Each browser accessing
							the Site is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine
							the size of our audience and the extent of repeat usage.

							(3) To track visitor trends and patterns. This should enable us to
							provide our visitors with more useful content and services.

							cookies to track visitor interactions as in our case, where they
							are used to collect information about how visitors use our site.
							We then use the information to compile reports and to help us
							improve our site. Google Analytics collects information
							anonymously. It reports website trends without identifying
							individual visitors. You can opt-out of Google Analytics without
							affecting how you visit our site – for more information on opting
