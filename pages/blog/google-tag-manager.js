In short, GTM empowers marketing teams to take control of tagging code, creating a clear distinction between the source code of your web applications and tagging events used for analytics in one place. The basic benefits of GTM are deployable by just about anyone who is willing to dedicate a little time to learn. Users with development experience can leverage GTM at much greater lengths.
