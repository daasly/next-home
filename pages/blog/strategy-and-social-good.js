          text2="1. Define your goals. This helps inform what data you collect by determining the top priorities and clarifying intentions for use and governance."
          text3="2. Identify bottlenecks. A comprehensive strategy enables access and consumption so everyone feels confident in their business intelligence."
          text4="3. Know the laws and regulations. There is an ethical and legal responsibility to know the laws surrounding proper privacy, security measures, and how and what data to collect and maintain."
