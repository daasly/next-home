                  text="Real-time data and alerts are valuable. Alerts in #googleanalytics, or any #bi tool, can be extremely useful but they can also create a distraction for your team. To best leverage real-time alerts, ensure there is a business need that necessitates an answer followed by a direct action that can take place to address each alert. You want to avoid having your sales floor upwards of 30 minutes a day looking at a monitor waiting for updates. 
                    Need help properly identifying the need for and setting up real-time alerts? Daasly can help! "
