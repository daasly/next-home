                    text="The vast majority of data collected and available today is semi-structured at best, this is profoundly true with small and mid-sized digital companies. All too often I run across companies that attempt to begin leveraging their data by seeking out the 'right' tools and tackling their data with all the great buzz words: Analytics, Machine Learning, Algorithms, Big Data, etc. In the end, your data is only as useful as it's collected, organized, and stored. However, these 3 key steps are often overshadowed by the front end deliverables of data and often times glanced over altogether. The more resources you commit to creating a sound data strategy focused on those 3 key areas, the more useful your data becomes. Think of your data strategy as a marathon and not a sprint. Invest in your data people more than your data tools."
